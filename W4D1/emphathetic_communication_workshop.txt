Exercise 1 (10-15 min)
Write down a note about a time that you had a communication breakdown - what went wrong?
My husband and I had a communication breakdown around plans for the evening. We both made assumptions about when the other person would check in about status and when they would loop in the person. Because expectations were established but not communicated, there was a breakdown. 
How do you most often communicate with others (are you more passive, assertive, aggressive, or passive aggressive)?
Iâ€™m most often assertive. But it depends on the audience, relationship, and setting.
How do you like to be communicated with?
I like to build some rapport and build up our relationship over time if at work. I like praise and words of affirmation but I also like direct communication and getting to the point. I think it depends again on the setting, the person, and the situation.
When was the last time you received critical feedback - how did you respond?
I responded poorly because it was my husband. I think when you are super close you tend to expect different things.
